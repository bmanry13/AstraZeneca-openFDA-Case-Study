# AstraZeneca-openFDA-Case-Study
## Introduction
The files in this repository were developed as part of an interview with AstraZeneca Oncology Machine Learning & AI. The general ask was to explore the drug adverse event reporting data available via the FDA's openFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) API at [https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/](https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/).

For ease of use I've created several rmarkdown files for the case study and have deployed them on a github.io site for viewing. The site can be accessed here [https://bmanry13.github.io/AstraZeneca-openFDA-Case-Study/index.html](https://bmanry13.github.io/AstraZeneca-openFDA-Case-Study/index.html). The notebooks contain API calls for accessing the data directly from FDA so can be run locally with a cloned repository.

The site pages include:
* **Documentation Review:** A documentation review/overview of the openFDA FAERS data and API. This section is a qualitative look at how the event data is collected, what the reports contain, and some general observations that I had related to the limitations or potential biases to consider when using the data.

* **Initial Data Exploration:** In this section I wanted to get a feel for how the various API syntax options operate, how/what data is returned by the API, and explore distibutions of values present in the data for select fields like reporter type, country, and event type.

* **Case Study - Target Drug Summary Report:**
